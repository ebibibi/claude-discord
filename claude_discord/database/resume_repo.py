"""Repository for pending session resumes after bot restart.

A Claude Code session that is about to restart the bot writes a row to
``pending_resumes`` via :meth:`PendingResumeRepository.mark`.  On startup
the bot calls :meth:`get_pending` to collect rows that are still within the
TTL window, processes them (re-spawning Claude in those threads), then calls
:meth:`delete` to prevent duplicate resumes.

Safety guarantees
-----------------
* **Single-fire**: rows are deleted immediately after being read, so a
  second restart within the TTL window does not cause a double-resume.
* **TTL**: rows older than *ttl_minutes* (default 5) are silently ignored
  and pruned, preventing stale resumes from triggering after a long downtime.
* **UNIQUE constraint** on ``thread_id``: only one pending resume per thread
  can exist at a time; writing a second one overwrites the first.
