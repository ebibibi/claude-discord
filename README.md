Use [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) from your phone. A thin Discord frontend that gives you **full Claude Code CLI access** through Discord threads — designed for mobile development when you're away from your terminal.

**[日本語](docs/ja/README.md)** | **[简体中文](docs/zh-CN/README.md)** | **[한국어](docs/ko/README.md)** | **[Español](docs/es/README.md)** | **[Português](docs/pt-BR/README.md)** | **[Français](docs/fr/README.md)**

> **Disclaimer:** This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to Anthropic. "Claude" and "Claude Code" are trademarks of Anthropic, PBC. This is an independent open-source tool that interfaces with the Claude Code CLI.

> **Built entirely by Claude Code.** This project was designed, implemented, tested, and documented by Claude Code itself — the AI coding agent from Anthropic. The human author has not read the source code. See [How This Project Was Built](#how-this-project-was-built) for details.

## Why This Exists

I run 3-4 projects in parallel with Claude Code. On my phone via [Termux](https://termux.dev/) + tmux, managing multiple terminal sessions became painful — which tmux window was which project? What was I doing in each one? The context-switching overhead killed my productivity.

**Discord solves this perfectly:**

- Each project conversation is a **named thread** — instantly scannable
- Threads preserve full history — come back hours later and pick up where you left off
- Emoji reactions show status at a glance — no need to scroll through terminal output
- Discord is free, works on every phone, and handles notifications natively

## What This Is (and Isn't)

**This is:** A focused bridge between Discord and Claude Code CLI. It spawns `claude -p --output-format stream-json` as a subprocess, parses the output, and posts it back to Discord. That's it.

**This is not:** A feature-rich Discord bot, an AI chatbot framework, or a replacement for the Claude Code terminal experience. There's no custom AI logic, no plugin system, no admin dashboard.

**Your Claude Code environment does the heavy lifting.** Your CLAUDE.md, skills, tools, memory, MCP servers — they all work exactly as they do in the terminal. This bridge just provides the UI layer.

**Security model:** Run it on your own private Discord server, in a channel only you can access. The bot is intentionally simple — fewer features means fewer attack surfaces. You built it yourself, you can read every line of code, and there's nothing phoning home.

## How It Compares

| | claude-code-discord-bridge | [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) & similar |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Mobile-first Claude Code access | Full-featured Discord AI bot |
| **AI backend** | Claude Code CLI (subprocess) | Direct API calls |
| **Features** | Minimal: threads, status, chunking | Extensive: plugins, admin, multi-model |
| **Configuration** | Your existing Claude Code setup | Bot-specific config |
| **Skills/tools** | Inherited from Claude Code | Defined in bot config |
| **Target user** | Developer who already uses Claude Code | Anyone wanting an AI Discord bot |
| **Complexity** | ~800 lines of Python | Thousands of lines |

**If you want a Discord AI chatbot**, use OpenClaw or similar projects — they're far more capable.

**If you want to use Claude Code from your phone**, with all your existing project context, skills, and tools — that's what this is for.

## Features

- **Thread = Session** — Each task gets its own Discord thread, mapped 1:1 to a Claude Code session
- **Real-time status** — Emoji reactions show what Claude is doing (🧠 thinking, 🛠️ reading files, 💻 editing, 🌐 web search)
- **Session persistence** — Continue conversations across messages via `--resume`
- **Skill execution** — Run Claude Code skills (`/skill goodmorning`) via slash commands with autocomplete
- **Webhook triggers** — Trigger Claude Code tasks from CI/CD pipelines via Discord webhooks
- **Auto-upgrade** — Automatically update the bot when upstream packages are released
- **REST API** — Push notifications to Discord from external tools (optional, requires aiohttp)
- **Fence-aware splitting** — Long responses split at natural boundaries, never breaking code blocks
- **Concurrent sessions** — Run multiple sessions in parallel (configurable limit)
- **Security hardened** — No shell injection, secrets stripped from subprocess env, user authorization

## How It Works

```
You (Discord)  →  Bridge  →  Claude Code CLI
    ↑                                      ↓
    ←──────── stream-json output ──────────←
```

1. Send a message in the configured Discord channel
2. The bot creates a thread and starts a Claude Code session
3. Stream-json output is parsed in real-time for status updates
4. Claude's response is posted back to the thread
5. Reply in the thread to continue the conversation

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- A Discord bot token with Message Content intent enabled
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

### Run standalone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ebibibi/claude-code-discord-bridge.git
cd claude-code-discord-bridge

cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your bot token and channel ID

uv run python -m claude_discord.main
```

### Install as a package

If you already have a discord.py bot running (Discord allows only one Gateway connection per token):

```bash
uv add git+https://github.com/ebibibi/claude-code-discord-bridge.git
```

```python
from claude_discord import ClaudeChatCog, ClaudeRunner, SessionRepository
from claude_discord.database.models import init_db

# Initialize
await init_db("data/sessions.db")
repo = SessionRepository("data/sessions.db")
runner = ClaudeRunner(command="claude", model="sonnet")

# Add to your existing bot
await bot.add_cog(ClaudeChatCog(bot, repo, runner))
```

Update to the latest version:

```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package claude-code-discord-bridge && uv sync
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Your Discord bot token | (required) |
| `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` | Channel ID for Claude chat | (required) |
| `CLAUDE_COMMAND` | Path to Claude Code CLI | `claude` |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | Model to use | `sonnet` |
| `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` | Permission mode for CLI | `acceptEdits` |
| `CLAUDE_WORKING_DIR` | Working directory for Claude | current dir |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS` | Max parallel sessions | `3` |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Session inactivity timeout | `300` |

## Discord Bot Setup

1. Create a new application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a bot and copy the token
3. Enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
4. Invite the bot to your server with these permissions:
   - Send Messages
   - Create Public Threads
   - Send Messages in Threads
   - Add Reactions
   - Manage Messages (for reaction cleanup)
   - Read Message History

## Webhook Integration

Trigger Claude Code tasks from CI/CD pipelines (e.g. GitHub Actions) via Discord webhooks.

```python
from claude_discord import WebhookTriggerCog, WebhookTrigger, ClaudeRunner

runner = ClaudeRunner(command="claude", model="sonnet")

triggers = {
    "🔄 docs-sync": WebhookTrigger(
        prompt="Update documentation based on latest code changes.",
        working_dir="/home/user/my-project",
        timeout=600,
    ),
    "🚀 deploy": WebhookTrigger(
        prompt="Deploy to staging environment.",
        timeout=300,
    ),
}

await bot.add_cog(WebhookTriggerCog(
    bot=bot,
    runner=runner,
    triggers=triggers,
    channel_ids={YOUR_CHANNEL_ID},
))
```

**How it works:**
1. Set up a Discord webhook in your channel
2. Send a message matching the trigger prefix (e.g. `🔄 docs-sync`)
3. The Cog creates a thread and runs Claude Code with the configured prompt
4. Results are streamed back to the thread in real-time

**Security:** Only webhook messages are processed. Optional `allowed_webhook_ids` for stricter control. Prompts are server-side — webhooks only select which trigger to fire.

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs-sync.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  trigger:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: |
          curl -X POST "${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"content": "🔄 docs-sync"}'
```

## Auto-Upgrade

Automatically upgrade the bot when an upstream package is released.

```python
from claude_discord import AutoUpgradeCog, UpgradeConfig

config = UpgradeConfig(
    package_name="claude-code-discord-bridge",
    trigger_prefix="🔄 bot-upgrade",
    working_dir="/home/user/my-bot",
    restart_command=["sudo", "systemctl", "restart", "my-bot.service"],
)

await bot.add_cog(AutoUpgradeCog(bot, config))
```

**Pipeline:** Upstream push → CI webhook → `🔄 bot-upgrade` → `uv lock --upgrade-package` → `uv sync` → service restart.

Custom commands are supported via `upgrade_command` and `sync_command` parameters.

## REST API

Optional REST API for pushing notifications to Discord from external tools. Requires aiohttp:

```bash
uv add "claude-code-discord-bridge[api]"
```

```python
from claude_discord import NotificationRepository
from claude_discord.ext.api_server import ApiServer

repo = NotificationRepository("data/notifications.db")
await repo.init_db()

api = ApiServer(
    repo=repo,
    bot=bot,
    default_channel_id=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID,
    host="127.0.0.1",
    port=8080,
    api_secret="your-secret-token",  # Optional Bearer auth
)
await api.start()
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/health` | Health check |
| POST | `/api/notify` | Send immediate notification |
| POST | `/api/schedule` | Schedule notification for later |
| GET | `/api/scheduled` | List pending notifications |
| DELETE | `/api/scheduled/{id}` | Cancel a scheduled notification |

### Examples

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health

# Send notification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret-token" \
  -d '{"message": "Build succeeded!", "title": "CI/CD"}'

# Schedule notification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/schedule \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Time to review PRs", "scheduled_at": "2026-01-01T09:00:00"}'
```

### Design Philosophy

- **No custom AI logic** — Claude Code handles all reasoning, tool use, and context
- **No memory system** — Claude Code's built-in sessions + CLAUDE.md handle memory
- **No tool definitions** — Claude Code has its own comprehensive tool set
- **No plugin system** — Add capabilities by configuring Claude Code, not this bot
- **Framework's job is purely UI** — Accept messages, show status, deliver responses

### Security

- `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` (not shell) prevents command injection
- Session IDs validated with strict regex before use
- `--` separator prevents prompt injection via flag interpretation
- Bot token and secrets stripped from the subprocess environment
- `allowed_user_ids` restricts who can invoke Claude
- Simple codebase (~800 LOC) — easy to audit yourself

## Testing

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v --cov=claude_discord
```

131 tests covering parser, chunker, repository, runner, webhook triggers, auto-upgrade, and REST API.

## How This Project Was Built

**This entire codebase was written by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)**, Anthropic's AI coding agent. The human author ([@ebibibi](https://github.com/ebibibi)) provided requirements and direction via natural language, but has not manually read or edited the source code.

This means:

- **All code was AI-generated** — architecture, implementation, tests, documentation
- **The human author cannot guarantee correctness at the code level** — review the source if you need assurance
- **Bug reports and PRs are welcome** — Claude Code will likely be used to address them too
- **This is a real-world example of AI-authored open source software** — use it as a reference for what Claude Code can build

The project was built in a single day (2026-02-18) through iterative conversation with Claude Code, starting from requirements and ending with a working, tested, documented package.

## Real-World Example

**[EbiBot](https://github.com/ebibibi/discord-bot)** — A personal Discord bot that uses claude-code-discord-bridge as a package dependency. Includes custom Cogs for push notifications, Todoist watchdog, and automated documentation sync. See it as a reference for how to build your own bot on top of this framework.
