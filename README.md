**Run multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel — safely — through Discord.**

Each Discord thread becomes an isolated Claude Code session. Spin up as many as you need: work on a feature in one thread, review a PR in another, run a scheduled task in a third. The bridge handles coordination automatically so concurrent sessions don't clobber each other.

## The Big Idea: Parallel Sessions Without Fear

When you send tasks to Claude Code in separate Discord threads, the bridge does four things automatically:

1. **Concurrency notice injection** — Every session's system prompt includes mandatory instructions: create a git worktree, work only inside it, never touch the main working directory directly.

2. **Active session registry** — Each running session knows about the others. If two sessions are about to touch the same repo, they can coordinate rather than conflict.

3. **Coordination channel** — A shared Discord channel where sessions broadcast start/end events. Both Claude and humans can see at a glance what's happening across all active threads.

4. **AI Lounge** — A session-to-session "breakroom" injected into every prompt. Before starting, each session reads recent lounge messages to see what other sessions are doing. Before disruptive operations (force push, bot restart, DB drop), sessions check the lounge first so they don't stomp on each other's work.

```
Thread A (feature)   ──→  Claude Code (worktree-A)  ─┐
Thread B (PR review) ──→  Claude Code (worktree-B)   ├─→  #ai-lounge
Thread C (docs)      ──→  Claude Code (worktree-C)  ─┘    "A: auth refactor in progress"
           ↓ lifecycle events                              "B: PR #42 review done"
   #coordination channel                                   "C: updating README"
   "A: started on auth refactor"
   "B: reviewing PR #42"
   "C: updating README"
```

No race conditions. No lost work. No merge surprises.

## What You Can Do

### Interactive Chat (Mobile / Desktop)

Use Claude Code from anywhere Discord runs — phone, tablet, or desktop. Each message creates or continues a thread, mapping 1:1 to a persistent Claude Code session.

### Parallel Development

Open multiple threads simultaneously. Each is an independent Claude Code session with its own context, working directory, and git worktree. Useful patterns:

- **Feature + review in parallel**: Start a feature in one thread while Claude reviews a PR in another.
- **Multiple contributors**: Different team members each get their own thread; sessions stay aware of each other via the coordination channel.
- **Experiment safely**: Try an approach in thread A while keeping thread B on stable code.

### Scheduled Tasks (SchedulerCog)

Register periodic Claude Code tasks from a Discord conversation or via REST API — no code changes, no redeploys. Tasks are stored in SQLite and run on a configurable schedule. Claude can self-register tasks during a session using `POST /api/tasks`.

```
/skill name:goodmorning         → runs immediately
Claude calls POST /api/tasks    → registers a periodic task
SchedulerCog (30s master loop)  → fires due tasks automatically
```

### CI/CD Automation

Trigger Claude Code tasks from GitHub Actions via Discord webhooks. Claude runs autonomously — reads code, updates docs, creates PRs, enables auto-merge.

```
GitHub Actions → Discord Webhook → Bridge → Claude Code CLI
                                                  ↓
GitHub PR ←── git push ←── Claude Code ──────────┘
```

**Real example:** On every push to `main`, Claude analyzes the diff, updates English + Japanese documentation, creates a bilingual PR, and enables auto-merge. Zero human interaction.

### Session Sync

Already use Claude Code CLI directly? Sync your existing terminal sessions into Discord threads with `/sync-sessions`. Backfills recent conversation messages so you can continue a CLI session from your phone without losing context.

### AI Lounge

A shared "breakroom" channel where all concurrent sessions announce themselves, read each other's updates, and coordinate before disruptive operations.

Each Claude session receives the lounge context automatically in its system prompt: recent messages from other sessions, plus the rule to check before doing anything destructive.

```bash
# Sessions post their intentions before starting:
curl -X POST "$CCDB_API_URL/api/lounge" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Starting auth refactor on feature/oauth — worktree-A", "label": "feature dev"}'

# Read recent lounge messages (also injected into each session automatically):
curl "$CCDB_API_URL/api/lounge"
```

The lounge channel doubles as a human-visible activity feed — open it in Discord to see at a glance what every active Claude session is currently doing.

### Programmatic Session Creation

Spawn new Claude Code sessions from scripts, GitHub Actions, or other Claude sessions — without Discord message interaction.

```bash
# From another Claude session or a CI script:
curl -X POST "$CCDB_API_URL/api/spawn" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Run security scan on the repo", "thread_name": "Security Scan"}'
# Returns immediately with the thread ID; Claude runs in the background
```

Claude subprocesses receive `DISCORD_THREAD_ID` as an environment variable, so a running session can spawn child sessions to parallelize work.

### Startup Resume

If the bot restarts mid-session, interrupted Claude sessions are automatically resumed when the bot comes back online. Sessions are marked for resume in three ways:

- **Automatic (upgrade restart)** — `AutoUpgradeCog` snapshots all active sessions just before a package upgrade restart and marks them automatically.
- **Automatic (any shutdown)** — `ClaudeChatCog.cog_unload()` marks all mid-run sessions whenever the bot shuts down via any mechanism (`systemctl stop`, `bot.close()`, SIGTERM, etc.).
- **Manual** — Any session can call `POST /api/mark-resume` directly.

## Features

### Interactive Chat
- **Thread = Session** — 1:1 mapping between Discord thread and Claude Code session
- **Real-time status** — Emoji reactions: 🧠 thinking, 🛠️ reading files, 💻 editing, 🌐 web search
- **Streaming text** — Intermediate assistant text appears as Claude works
- **Tool result embeds** — Live tool call results with elapsed time ticking up every 10s
- **Extended thinking** — Reasoning shown as spoiler-tagged embeds (click to reveal)
- **Session persistence** — Resume conversations across messages via `--resume`
- **Skill execution** — `/skill` command with autocomplete, optional args, in-thread resume
- **Hot reload** — New skills added to `~/.claude/skills/` are picked up automatically (60s refresh, no restart)
- **Concurrent sessions** — Multiple parallel sessions with configurable limit
- **Stop without clearing** — `/stop` halts a session while preserving it for resume
- **Attachment support** — Text files auto-appended to prompt (up to 5 × 50 KB)
- **Timeout notifications** — Embed with elapsed time and resume guidance on timeout
- **Interactive questions** — `AskUserQuestion` renders as Discord Buttons or Select Menu; session resumes with your answer; buttons survive bot restarts
- **Thread dashboard** — Live pinned embed showing which threads are active vs. waiting; owner @-mentioned when input is needed
- **Token usage** — Cache hit rate and token counts shown in session-complete embed
- **Context usage** — Context window percentage shown in session-complete embed; ⚠️ auto-compact warning at 83.5% full
- **Compact detection** — Notifies in-thread when context compaction occurs (trigger type + token count before compact)
- **Session interrupt** — Sending a new message to an active thread sends SIGINT to the running session and starts fresh with the new instruction; no manual `/stop` needed
- **Hard stall notification** — Thread message after 30 s of no activity (extended thinking or context compression); resets automatically when Claude resumes

### Concurrency & Coordination
- **Worktree instructions auto-injected** — Every session prompted to use `git worktree` before touching any file
- **Automatic worktree cleanup** — Session worktrees (`wt-{thread_id}`) are removed automatically at session end and on bot startup; dirty worktrees are never auto-removed (safety invariant)
- **Active session registry** — In-memory registry; each session sees what the others are doing
- **AI Lounge** — Shared "breakroom" channel injected into every session prompt; sessions post intentions, read each other's status, and check before disruptive operations; humans see it as a live activity feed
- **Coordination channel** — Optional shared channel for cross-session lifecycle broadcasts
- **Coordination scripts** — Claude can call `coord_post.py` / `coord_read.py` from within a session to post and read events

### Scheduled Tasks
- **SchedulerCog** — SQLite-backed periodic task executor with a 30-second master loop
- **Self-registration** — Claude registers tasks via `POST /api/tasks` during a chat session
- **No code changes** — Add, remove, or modify tasks at runtime
- **Enable/disable** — Pause tasks without deleting them (`PATCH /api/tasks/{id}`)

### CI/CD Automation
- **Webhook triggers** — Trigger Claude Code tasks from GitHub Actions or any CI/CD system
- **Auto-upgrade** — Automatically update the bot when upstream packages are released
- **DrainAware restart** — Waits for active sessions to finish before restarting
- **Auto-resume marking** — Active sessions are automatically marked for resume on any shutdown (upgrade restart via `AutoUpgradeCog`, or any other shutdown via `ClaudeChatCog.cog_unload()`); they pick up where they left off after the bot comes back online
- **Restart approval** — Optional gate to confirm upgrades before applying

### Session Management
- **Session sync** — Import CLI sessions as Discord threads (`/sync-sessions`)
- **Session list** — `/sessions` with filtering by origin (Discord / CLI / all) and time window
- **Resume info** — `/resume-info` shows the CLI command to continue the current session in a terminal
- **Startup resume** — Interrupted sessions restart automatically after any bot reboot; `AutoUpgradeCog` (upgrade restarts) and `ClaudeChatCog.cog_unload()` (all other shutdowns) mark them automatically, or use `POST /api/mark-resume` manually
- **Programmatic spawn** — `POST /api/spawn` creates a new Discord thread + Claude session from any script or Claude subprocess; returns non-blocking 201 immediately after thread creation
- **Thread ID injection** — `DISCORD_THREAD_ID` env var is passed to every Claude subprocess, enabling sessions to spawn child sessions via `$CCDB_API_URL/api/spawn`
- **Worktree management** — `/worktree-list` shows all active session worktrees with clean/dirty status; `/worktree-cleanup` removes orphaned clean worktrees (supports `dry_run` preview)
- **Runtime model switching** — `/model-show` displays the current global model and per-thread session model; `/model-set` changes the model for all new sessions without restart

### Security
- **No shell injection** — `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` only, never `shell=True`
- **Session ID validation** — Strict regex before passing to `--resume`
- **Flag injection prevention** — `--` separator before all prompts
- **Secret isolation** — Bot token stripped from subprocess environment
- **User authorization** — `allowed_user_ids` restricts who can invoke Claude

## Quick Start — Claude in Discord in 5 Minutes

### Step 1 — Create a Discord Bot (one-time, ~2 minutes)

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → **New Application**
2. Navigate to **Bot** → enable **Message Content Intent** under Privileged Gateway Intents
3. Copy the bot **Token**
4. Go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**: Scopes `bot` + `applications.commands`, Permissions: Send Messages, Create Public Threads, Send Messages in Threads, Add Reactions, Manage Messages, Read Message History
5. Open the generated URL → invite the bot to your server

### Step 2 — Run the Setup Wizard

No cloning or `.env` editing required — the wizard does it for you:

```bash
# With uvx (no install needed):
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/ebibibi/claude-code-discord-bridge.git" ccdb setup

# Or after cloning:
git clone https://github.com/ebibibi/claude-code-discord-bridge.git
cd claude-code-discord-bridge
uv run ccdb setup
```

The wizard will:
1. Validate your bot token against the Discord API
2. **Automatically list available channels** — just pick a number (no ID copying)
3. Ask for your working directory and model preference
4. Write `.env` and offer to start the bot immediately

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║          ccdb setup — interactive wizard             ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Step 1 — Claude Code CLI
  ✅  claude found

Step 2 — Discord Bot Token
  Bot Token: [paste here]
  Validating token… ✅  Logged in as MyBot#1234

Step 3 — Discord Channel ID
  Fetching channels via Discord API… ✅  Found 5 text channel(s)

   1. #general        (My Server)
   2. #claude-code    (My Server)
   3. #dev            (My Server)
   ...

  Select channel [1-5]: 2
  ✅  #claude-code (123456789012345678)

  ...

  ✅  Written: .env
  Start the bot now? [Y/n]: y
```

### Start / Stop

```bash
ccdb start    # start the bot (reads .env in current dir)
ccdb start --env /path/to/.env   # custom .env location
```

Send a message in the configured channel — Claude will reply in a new thread.

---

### Minimal Bot (Install as a Package)

If you already have a discord.py bot, add ccdb as a package instead:

```bash
uv add git+https://github.com/ebibibi/claude-code-discord-bridge.git
```

Create a `bot.py`:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from claude_discord import ClaudeRunner, setup_bridge

load_dotenv()

intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="!", intents=intents)
runner = ClaudeRunner(
    command="claude",
    model="sonnet",
    working_dir="/path/to/your/project",
)

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f"Logged in as {bot.user}")
    await setup_bridge(
        bot,
        runner,
        claude_channel_id=int(os.environ["DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID"]),
        allowed_user_ids={int(os.environ["DISCORD_OWNER_ID"])},
    )

asyncio.run(bot.start(os.environ["DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"]))
```

`setup_bridge()` wires all Cogs automatically. Update to the latest version:

```bash
uv lock --upgrade-package claude-code-discord-bridge && uv sync
```

## GitHub + Claude Code Automation

### Example: Automated Documentation Sync

On every push to `main`, Claude Code:
1. Pulls the latest changes and analyzes the diff
2. Updates English documentation
3. Translates to Japanese (or any target languages)
4. Creates a PR with a bilingual summary
5. Enables auto-merge — merges automatically when CI passes

**GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs-sync.yml
name: Documentation Sync
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  trigger:
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[docs-sync]')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: |
          curl -X POST "${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"content": "🔄 docs-sync"}'
```

**Bot configuration:**

```python
from claude_discord import WebhookTriggerCog, WebhookTrigger, ClaudeRunner

runner = ClaudeRunner(command="claude", model="sonnet")

triggers = {
    "🔄 docs-sync": WebhookTrigger(
        prompt="Analyze changes, update docs, create a PR with bilingual summary, enable auto-merge.",
        working_dir="/home/user/my-project",
        timeout=600,
    ),
}

await bot.add_cog(WebhookTriggerCog(
    bot=bot,
    runner=runner,
    triggers=triggers,
    channel_ids={YOUR_CHANNEL_ID},
))
```

**Security:** Prompts are defined server-side. Webhooks only select which trigger to fire — no arbitrary prompt injection.

### Example: Auto-Approve Owner PRs

```yaml
# .github/workflows/auto-approve.yml
name: Auto Approve Owner PRs
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
jobs:
  auto-approve:
    if: github.event.pull_request.user.login == 'your-username'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
      contents: write
    steps:
      - env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
        run: |
          gh pr review "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" --approve
          gh pr merge "$PR_NUMBER" --repo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" --auto --squash
```

---

## Scheduled Tasks

Register periodic Claude Code tasks at runtime — no code changes, no redeploys.

From within a Discord session, Claude can register a task:

```bash
# Claude calls this inside a session:
curl -X POST "$CCDB_API_URL/api/tasks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Check for outdated deps and open an issue if found", "interval_seconds": 604800}'
```

Or register from your own scripts:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Weekly security scan", "interval_seconds": 604800}'
```

The 30-second master loop picks up due tasks and spawns Claude Code sessions automatically.

---

## Auto-Upgrade

Automatically upgrade the bot when a new release is published:

```python
from claude_discord import AutoUpgradeCog, UpgradeConfig

config = UpgradeConfig(
    package_name="claude-code-discord-bridge",
    trigger_prefix="🔄 bot-upgrade",
    working_dir="/home/user/my-bot",
    restart_command=["sudo", "systemctl", "restart", "my-bot.service"],
    restart_approval=True,  # React with ✅ to confirm restart
)

await bot.add_cog(AutoUpgradeCog(bot, config))
```

Before restarting, `AutoUpgradeCog`:

1. **Snapshots active sessions** — Collects all threads with running Claude sessions (duck-typed: any Cog with `_active_runners` dict is discovered automatically).
2. **Drains** — Waits for active sessions to finish naturally.
3. **Marks for resume** — Saves active thread IDs to the pending-resumes table. On next startup, those sessions are resumed automatically with a "bot restarted, please continue" prompt.
4. **Restarts** — Executes the configured restart command.

Any Cog with an `active_count` property is auto-discovered and drained:

```python
class MyCog(commands.Cog):
    @property
    def active_count(self) -> int:
        return len(self._running_tasks)
```

Session marking is fully opt-in — it only activates when `setup_bridge()` has initialized the session database (the default). When enabled, sessions resume with `--resume` continuity so Claude Code can pick up the exact conversation where it left off.

> **Coverage:** `AutoUpgradeCog` covers upgrade-triggered restarts. For *all other* shutdowns (`systemctl stop`, `bot.close()`, SIGTERM), `ClaudeChatCog.cog_unload()` provides a second automatic safety net.

---

## REST API

Optional REST API for notifications and task management. Requires aiohttp:

```bash
uv add "claude-code-discord-bridge[api]"
```

### Endpoints

### Design Philosophy

- **CLI spawn, not API** — Invokes `claude -p --output-format stream-json`, giving full Claude Code features (CLAUDE.md, skills, tools, memory) without reimplementing them
- **Concurrency first** — Multiple simultaneous sessions are the expected case, not an edge case; every session gets worktree instructions, the registry and coordination channel handle the rest
- **Discord as glue** — Discord provides UI, threading, reactions, webhooks, and persistent notifications; no custom frontend needed
- **Framework, not application** — Install as a package, add Cogs to your existing bot, configure via code
- **Zero-code extensibility** — Add scheduled tasks and webhook triggers without touching source
- **Security by simplicity** — ~8000 lines of auditable Python; subprocess exec only, no shell expansion

## How This Project Was Built

**This codebase is developed by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)**, Anthropic's AI coding agent, under the direction of [@ebibibi](https://github.com/ebibibi). The human author defines requirements, reviews pull requests, and approves all changes — Claude Code does the implementation.

This means:

- **Implementation is AI-generated** — architecture, code, tests, documentation
- **Human review is applied at the PR level** — every change goes through GitHub pull requests and CI before merging
- **Bug reports and PRs are welcome** — Claude Code will be used to address them
- **This is a real-world example of human-directed, AI-implemented open source software**

The project started on 2026-02-18 and continues to evolve through iterative conversation with Claude Code.
